LeafCutter: Annotation-free quantification of RNA splicing. 

Yang I Li, David A Knowles, Jonathan K Pritchard.

To compile the R package to perform differential splicing analysis and make junction plots:
```
cd leafcutter
R CMD INSTALL --build .
```

Note you'll need the following R packages: 

 `install.packages("rstan", "foreach", "ggplot2", "R.utils", "gridExtra", "reshape2", "Hmisc", "optparse", "doMC")`. 

For a (hopefully) complete example of the complete pipeline, take a look at
